# React + Vite - SBA 320: React Web Application Project âœ”


### Objectives:
*  -  The content, context, and objective of your application is entirely up to you. Be creative, and think of something that will both allow you to demonstrate the skills you've acquired thus far and solve a need (practical or fictional).
*  -  Once you have an idea for your project, keeping the below requirements and resources in mind, speak to your instructor to have your project approved before you begin. This will ensure you're on the right track from the start, and not running into unforseen issues or wasting time on something that will not satisfy the assignment's objectives.
*  -  Find an API: Please be extremely thorough when finding an API you'd like to use for your project. In other words, please ensure you have properly vetted your API by taking the time to read its documentation and even "hitting a few endpoints". Take the time to test the API, see how you can get it to respond with data, and see what that data looks like.

### Instructions:
*  -  Put everything you've learned to the test and apply it to a practical web application.
